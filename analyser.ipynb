    "For this project we fed two types of semantic embeddings to the same feedforward neural network architecture. We obtained 72.5% test accuracy with the first, TF-IDF based method, and 84.74% with the Word2Vec embeddings. This is not surprising, since Word2Vec representation has advantages in capturing semantic meaning over TF-IDF. However, in a restricted domain TF-IDF may still outperform Word2Vec if word frequency information is highly suggestive of the labelling. In any case, a more extensive hyperparameter search may improve both performances. "
